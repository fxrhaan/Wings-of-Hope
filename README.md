<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>For those who are interested in finding random paragraphs, that's exactly what this webpage provides. If both a random word and a random sentence aren't quite long enough for your needs, then a random paragraph might be the perfect solution. Once you arrive at this page, you'll see a random paragraph. If you need another one, all you need to do is click on the "next paragraph" button. If you happen to need several random paragraphs all at once, you can use this other paragraph generator. Below you can find a number of ways that this generator can be used.

Text Blocks
There are a number of reasons you may need a block of text and when you do, a random paragraph can be the perfect solution. If you happen to be a web designer and you need some random text to show in your layout, a random paragraph can be an excellent way to do this. If you're a programmer and you need random text to test the program, using these paragraphs can be the perfect way to do this. Anyone who's in search of realistic text for a project can use one or more of these random paragraphs to fill their need.

Improve Writing
For writers looking for a way to get their creative writing juices flowing, using a random paragraph can be a great way to do this. One of the great benefits of this tool is that nobody knows what is going to appear in the paragraph. This can be leveraged in a few different ways to force the writer to use creativity. For example, the random paragraph can be used as the beginning paragraph of a story that the writer must finish. I can also be used as a paragraph somewhere inside a short story, or for a more difficult creative challenge, it can be used as the ending paragraph. In every case, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the random paragraph into the story.</p>
